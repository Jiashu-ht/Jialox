# Jialox

A crafting interpreter of programming language Jialox implemented in rust, which is based on book "[CRAFTING INTERPRETERS](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html)" and authored by [Jiashu](https://github.com/Jiashu-ht).

I started learning this book from [Uncle Scientist](https://www.youtube.com/@UncleScientist), a youtuber who has released many practical Rust tutorials. Welcome to subscribe to his channel. This [series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdoAJ_ouWRM) of videos teaches this book.

# Run

# Read and execute line by line.

# Read an entrie file and excute.
cargo run -- example.txt

```

# Introduction

This project is divided into different release versions based on chapter learning, for example, Section 4 corresponds to version 0.1.0, Section 5 corresponds to version 0.2.0, and so on. Alternatively, you can directly refer to the [Release branches](#release-branches) to find the desired version.

You can start learning from version 0.1.0, gradually improve from a small project, and finally complete the entire interpreter. It is really impressive!

# Release branches

- release/0.1.0

This version completes the content of [Section 4 Scanning](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/scanning.html).
